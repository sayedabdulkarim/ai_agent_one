# Steps to Create an AI Agent Application

1. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   - Ensure you have the necessary environment variables set up:
     ```bash
     export SERPER_API_KEY='your_serper_api_key'
     export OPEN_AI_KEY='your_open_ai_key'
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed. Run the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Initialize the Language Model**
   - In your Python script, initialize the language model:
     ```python
     from langchain_ollama import OllamaLLM

     llm = OllamaLLM(
         base_url="http://localhost:11434",
         model="llama3.2:1b",
         verbose=True
     )
     ```

4. **Create AI Agents**
   - Define your AI agents with specific roles, goals, and tools:
     ```python
     from crewai import Agent
     from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

     search_tool = SerperDevTool()

     researcher = Agent(
         role='senior_researcher',
         goal='Uncover ground breaking technologies in { topic }',
         verbose=True,
         backstory=(
             "Driven by curiosity, you are at the forefront of"
             "innovation, eager to explore and share knowledge that could change "
             "the world." 
         ),
         tools=[search_tool],
         allow_delegation=True
     )

     writer = Agent(
         role='writer',
         goal='Write a report on { topic }',
         backstory=(
             "You are a skilled writer, able to transform complex ideas into "
             "engaging content. Your mission is to communicate the latest "
             "technological advancements to a broad audience."
         ),
         tools=[search_tool],
         allow_delegation=True
     )
     ```

5. **Test the Language Model**
   - Add a test function to check if the language model is working:
     ```python
     def test_llm():
         prompt = ["What is the future of AI?"]
         response = llm.generate(prompts=prompt)
         print("LLM Response:", response)

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         test_llm()
     ```

6. **Run the Python Script**
   - Navigate to the directory containing your script and run it:
     ```bash
     cd /Users/saykarim/Desktop/ai-ml/agent_proj/agent_one/python-project/src
     python crew_ai_project.py
     ```

7. **Verify Output**
   - Check the console output to verify that the language model ([llm](http://_vscodecontentref_/0)) and agents are working correctly. You should see a response from the language model.

8. **Modify Agents as Needed**
   - If you need to modify the agents (e.g., change their roles, goals, or tools), edit the [crew_ai_project.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/1) file accordingly.

9. **Test Changes**
   - After making any changes, re-run the script to test the new configuration:
     ```bash
     python crew_ai_project.py
     ```

10. **Debugging**
    - If you encounter any issues, check the error messages and ensure all dependencies and environment variables are correctly set up.

11. **Documentation**
    - Keep this `steps.txt` file updated with any new steps or changes to the process.

By following these steps, you can create and test an AI agent application using the provided code as a starting point.
